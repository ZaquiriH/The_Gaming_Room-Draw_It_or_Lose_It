# The_Gaming_Room-Draw_It_or_Lose_It

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Client was "The Gaming Room", a game developing company that asked me to help them expand their web application, "Draw It or Lose It", to more platforms. 
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I beleive I provided an thorough examination, explanation, and reccomendation for the right approach to achieve the client's goals.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- I think a design documnet is a vital piece of material when developing code, as it can help layout requirements, constraints, design goals, and specific or general implementations of development.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I think the operating systems evaluation could use a greater expansion, to include more specific data and citations which would provide evidence to support the points made in the comparison
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The user's needs are the basis of the design document. Beginning with clear and concise user needs provides a way to easily build goals, requirements, and constraints, and mitigates the the artistic liscence or feature-creep that may arise from a lack of vision.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- The approach should always start with hashing out the goals, requirments, and contraints of developing. I've recently learned a lot about testing techniques, which is also an important aspect of development, and in the future, I think I will implement test-driven development to desgin an application like this one.
